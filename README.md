Sentiment Analysis on twitter

This repository consists of a csv and a code snippet to perform a simple sentiment analysis on twitter data.
The idea is to fetch data from some source, in this case a csv containing up and coming ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings), and by connecting
to twitter search the tweets that has the ICO's mentioning in them. After gathering all tweets perform a sentiment analysis giving
polarity and subjectivity of a tweet based on how many mentioning the ICO has had.

In order to use the code yourself you will need to acquire some tokens for a twitter API to be able to connect to it. That can be done by
connecting to developer tools for twitter and creating an app. After that is done you can go to the Token and Keys category and copy them 
into the code.
